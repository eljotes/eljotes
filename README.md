Hello, I'm @eljotes. I have many different interests. From computers to folding doors. Literally
In my past I was doing some coding in C++/C# and Java. I was making websites so I know some HTML/CSS/PHP/JS.
Now I started my journey with 3D printing. I have Ender 3 Pro printer and I'm doing some mods, upgrades etc.
Printing funny stuffs or just tring to make it, whole printer, more complex like cnc with changable tools.
